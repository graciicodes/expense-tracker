## Summary

This is a straightforward expense-tracking web application developed using pure JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS Flexbox styling. It was an enjoyable and interesting project that allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of working with HTML tables and rows. I had the opportunity to create various input functions for text, dropdowns, dates, and dollar amounts. Moreover, I learned how to dynamically add or remove table rows using Vanilla JavaScript. This expense tracker app enables users to log their expenses, similar to keeping a checkbook register. Each expense is organized into distinct columns to record transaction details, including type (such as cash), date, amount in dollars, and description.
